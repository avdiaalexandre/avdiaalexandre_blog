Here are a few examples (some of them are based on examples I've read on blogs so far):

- Sept. 25th: I downloaded the 'BBC News' App on my phone. I've started reading/watching the news on the train for 15 min.

- Oct. 6th: I watched 2 episodes of Peaky blinders. Very difficult accent

- Oct. 12th: I read all the lyrics of "favourite worst nightmare" on genius. I understand

- Oct. 10th: I went to an English evening. It was nice. Even though I was a bit scared at first, it was easy to speak with people, as everyone has a different English level and I realised my English level is not that bad. I met nice people, an American guy from SHAPE and a Korean girl who's in Mons for a year.

- Oct. 22nd: I watched a documentary about abortion. Very serious topic and not fun at all but I learned a lot of interesting facts about abortion around the world.

- Oct. 27th: I started using Lyricstraining. This is soooo much fun. I love doing karaoke with my sister and we play together to guess the missing words. I love it!

- Oct. 30th: I decided to change my device language into English. Now my smartphone, PS4 and Ipad are all configured in English.

The bottom line is: have fun! It's a very important component when learning a new language.
